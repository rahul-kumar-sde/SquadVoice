Project based on HTML, CSS and JS

The approach that I followed for this project is:
1. I divided the body into 3 divs:
        a) Offline
        b) Main Page
        c) Modal
2. And when the browser is offline, Offline is visible, and the rest are hidden.
3. When the browser is online, the Main page is visible, and the rest are hidden.
4. When the popup opens, Offline is hidden, Main page is blurred and Modal is at focus.

The hidden, blurred and popup is handled by hide, blur-filter and pop classes respectively using HTML,CSS and Js.
